Based on the open source [Benchtop Power product from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12867) and uses the same materials, except for an additional 16-pin molex connector to go along with the 24-pin one. Thanks for sharing, Sparkfun! I resized the board to fit within the limits of Eagle's free light version.

As you'll see, the only thing used on the 24 pin connector are the GND connections and the power switch, so that could be eliminated with some simple wiring when installing the board.
